<h3>Claim Site Up</h3>
<h4>31-Jan-13</h4>
<p>
I've put this claim site up by taking the WBX code and removing most of its functionality.  You can still see your statement and balances, but that's about all.  I'll be adding a form where you can provide your Bitcoin address for your refund, and re-enabling the document upload for users who still need to verify their identity.
</p>
<p>
I just checked the site balances.  According to the database, and the the current exchange rates of $20 USD/BTC and 0.961444 AUD/USD, I'm holding around 56% of total client funds.  Some clients are owed funds which aren't in the database, so the final figure will probably be a little lower than 56%.
</p>
<p>
The percentage will also change with the exchange rates.  The exchange rates as of 3:39pm PDT, Monday 11th March 2013 will be used for the final calculation, as discussed in <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=65867.msg1468678#msg1468678" target="_blank">this forum post</a>.
