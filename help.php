<h3>Help</h3>
<p>For safety, please keep funds off-site when not trading.</p>
<p>To begin trading, navigate to the <a href="?page=">front page</a>, enter your desired amount and click buy. The trade will materialise in the orderbook and under your profile. You will not be able to view any info from other traders accounts for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>You may cancel an order by viewing the desired order (found under your profile). Click cancel to revoke any current orders. You will not get a full refund on partially completed orders.</p>
