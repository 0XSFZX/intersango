Dear Brett Wolf,

I have become aware of your article and would like to offer you more
information. While MTGox (the largest exchange) is not reachable, I am
able to put you in communication with lead developers as well as the
owners and operators of the 2nd and 3rd biggest exchanges.

Bitomat (Bitomat.pl) - The Polish exchange which today transfered 40,000
$ worth of bitcoins 24 hours.

Britcoin (Britcoin.co.uk) - The UK exchange which transacted 25,000$
worth of bitcoins in the last 24 hours.


Bitcoin was not developed as a means to transact and support the illegal
drug trade. It's creator and early developers are clearly idealists
wishing to change the inequalities in the world, especially when it
comes to financial transactions.

I am personally in talks with the head of SWIFT which has been the world
standard in banking transfers for 30 years. SWIFT is the backbone of
more than 9000 banks across the world. A more efficient means of
commerce will not only make the world richer but help those less well
off.

If you simply look at the spreads on Western Union, you will see the
excessive fees.

While the MTGox owner is unreachable, we are more than happy inform you
as to the nature of bitcoin and it's true purpose and prolific
advantages.

As Bitcoin is decentralized, no one is an official spokesperson... A
system like this has it's advantages and disadvantages. One disadvantage
is that there is no organized and collective movement to champion the
prolific nature of Bitcoin. It would be a shame to lose so much
opportunity for social good and a wealthier world for all its
inhabitants due to the careless and blind dismissal of Bitcoin.


Please contact us.
